# Python Mini Projects
Welcome to my collection of mini Python projects! Each project in this repository addresses a unique challenge and demonstrates a variety of programming concepts and skills.
Through these projects, I've deepened my understanding of Python and explored practical applications of its features.

Projects Included:

1. Authentication Decorator
2. CTF Challenge
3. Currency Exchange Rate Viewer
4. Execution Time Decorator
5. IP and Domain Analyzer
6. PokÃ©mon Information Viewer
7. Server Log Analyzer

Knowledge Gained:

* File Handling: Mastered reading from and writing to files, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.
* API Integration: Learned to interact with external APIs to fetch, process, and utilize data in various formats.
* Decorators: Implemented decorators to add functionality to functions, such as user authentication and execution time measurement.
* Data Analysis: Developed skills in filtering and analyzing data, generating insightful statistics, and visualizing results with Matplotlib.
* OCR and Image Processing: Explored Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to extract text from images and process visual data.
  
Each project is organized in its own directory, complete with a description and easy-to-follow setup instructions where needed.
